# AVBOB.Policy.Application

#Instructions on how to run the app:
1. Execute the scripts located in "AVBOB.Policy.Application\source\AVBOB.Policy.Application\Entities\AVBOB.Policy.Application.Entities\Scripts" on MS SQL
2. Run "npm install" using cmd on the path "AVBOB.Policy.Application\source\AVBOB.Policy.Application\Web" and then run "npm start"
3. Open the solution "AVBOB.Policy.Application\source\AVBOB.Policy.Application\AVBOB.Policy.Application.sln" and run the entire solution to start the API

#Additional Requirements
3. Application forms on DR site
   -> The application forms are saved on file system and I would use the already existing API to serve these files incase of disaster and they will always be available.
   -> They will just have to be named appropriately(using the initials, surname and timestamp) so that they can be easily identified.
